# Final-Project

RUNNING THE APPLICATION: 
Click on app.py and run the code, and then go to the link:http://127.0.0.1:5000, you can see the content.
We will use Flask to create a web application for our project. We will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface. The web application can provide a list of movies with the basic information of movies, such as name, and genre, for users to select and prompt the users to enter the details of the movie they want to analyze, such as the cast and crew, genres, and release year. 

INTERACTION AND OPERATION:
Once you successfully open the webpage，and then enter the movie information page, which contains over 2000 integrated movie information.
What we need to do is select a movie, copy and paste its year, runtime, director, and star information onto the Popularity Prediction page.
After filling in the corresponding information on the Popularity Prediction page and clicking submit, the program will automatically predict the popularity of the movie for you through the decision tree.

Data Structure:
For the data which will be used in the decision tree, we plan to use the genres like directors, stars, and release year as the feature names, which will be stored in a list. And the movie names will be stored in a list to work as the feature classes. In this way, when we create our decision tree, it’s quite clear the features and the classes.
